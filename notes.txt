Intro text is around POSM.EXE:b880.
You can replace with ascii text but it gets stretched out to twice its width onscreen.

First save file's "look inside" text is at POS1.DSD:90.
Ascii text shows up perfectly here.

Except for the nametags, they need a text hack. (Nametags are read from the table at POS.EXE:a100)
	Table is in memory at seg 26a2
	Reads 2 bytes at a time (al, then mov ah, [si], inc si)

	Try cancelling out the mov ah, [si], inc si. (8a2446, at 2440:25be)


	Replace:
	7502 jnz 25be
	eb13 jmp 25d1

	with:
	7415 jz 25d1


	After the lodsb:

	7415 jz 25d1
	88c4 mov ah, al
	b082 mov al, 82
	90 nop

	string is:
	741588c4b08290

	It just really doesn't want to read from column 08...

	Nametag rendering:     2440:25b7
	Normal text rendering: 2440:23ef
		if it's lower than 80:
			mov ah, ff
			mov cs:[2e34], ah
			call 28cd
		Does some stuff, removes ah, then stosw.
			So, "H" gets written as 48 00. (Oh! Column 00, not 08)
		The stuff getting read to VRAM gets spaced out differently. Nametag things have extra 00-00s between the letters.
			Remove the two inc di's to stop this and get the text to be normal.

		Now the 8140's are rendered as _@ all the way out to the text.
			Just replace them with ascii spaces and it renders fine.

	Final hack:
	begins with ac3c0d

	7415 jz 25d1
	30e4 xor ah, ah
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90

	then, after abe82b03, 90 90 again

	first string is: 741530e49090909090909090
