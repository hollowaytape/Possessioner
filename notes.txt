Intro text is around POSM.EXE:b880.
You can replace with ascii text but it gets stretched out to twice its width onscreen.
	When reading a character, it branches and does stuff with cs:[08a2] and cs:[08a3].
		If x < 80, mov 1 into 08a2
		If 08a2 == 01, check if al is 0a
		If al == 20, mov 1 into 08a3
		else mov 2 into 08a3

		Are spaces still 01 width? Looks like it...
		2ec606a30802 mov cs:[08a3], 02
			-> Change it to mov 01
			This edits the cursor movement, but the characters are still doublewide. Y'know what i mean

		W is 57, gets flipped to 5700 and put in dx
		Eventually moved back to al, where it gets sub al, 20
			Then mult by 20 (6e0)
	Dialogue and exposition text in the intro seem to behave differently. Dialogue is double wide and double tall, exposition is just double wide


First save file's "look inside" text is at POS1.DSD:90.
Ascii text shows up perfectly here.

Except for the nametags, they need a text hack. (Nametags are read from the table at POS.EXE:a100)
	Table is in memory at seg 26a2
	Reads 2 bytes at a time (al, then mov ah, [si], inc si)

	Try cancelling out the mov ah, [si], inc si. (8a2446, at 2440:25be)


	Replace:
	7502 jnz 25be
	eb13 jmp 25d1

	with:
	7415 jz 25d1


	After the lodsb:

	7415 jz 25d1
	88c4 mov ah, al
	b082 mov al, 82
	90 nop

	string is:
	741588c4b08290

	It just really doesn't want to read from column 08...

	Nametag rendering:     2440:25b7
	Normal text rendering: 2440:23ef
		if it's lower than 80:
			mov ah, ff
			mov cs:[2e34], ah
			call 28cd
		Does some stuff, removes ah, then stosw.
			So, "H" gets written as 48 00. (Oh! Column 00, not 08)
		The stuff getting read to VRAM gets spaced out differently. Nametag things have extra 00-00s between the letters.
			Remove the two inc di's to stop this and get the text to be normal.

		Now the 8140's are rendered as _@ all the way out to the text.
			Just replace them with ascii spaces and it renders fine.

	Final hack:
	begins with ac3c0d

	7415 jz 25d1
	30e4 xor ah, ah
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90
	90

	then, after abe82b03, 90 90 again

	first string is: 741530e49090909090909090



Dump is quite large, it's about 15,173 lines after some garbage removal...

.MSD file format:
	* Look Room:            f2 01 f4 01 f5 00
	* Talk Honghua 2: f0 07 f2 01 f4 01 f5 00 (Arisa speaks)
	*                 f0 05 f2 03 f4 06 f5 00 (Honghua speaks)
	* When I reinsert something, the first line's color gets messed up in all the lines after the inserted one. The text itself is fine though...
		* Maybe it's skipping the first 3 bytes of the control code then??
