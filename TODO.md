# TODO
* Can I reliably add another line to some dialogue? The [LN] control code doesn't seem to work.
	* Does each pointer have a number of lines it's expected to read?
* Reinsert and map more files.
* Hack the intro text to be halfwidth
	* Already have a cursor-increment hack.
	* Also it doesn't display commas/apostrophes correctly?
* Look at .CGX
* More .SEL images to edit
	* A_AR6.SEL - top secret thing that belongs to Nedra?
	* LISTP.SEL - names of possessioners. (If the spellings change, change this too)
	* LM1.SEL-LM7.SEL - description text of possessioners. Definitely gotta translate this
* I could probably refer to HP and MP as <3 and * respectively. (with SJIS)

## Bugs in original version
* You select a target for Meryl's Grenade, but it hits all enemies...
