# TODO
* Battle crashes. Is this related to a bad pointer somewhere from pos1.msd or yumi.msd?
* Hack the intro text to be halfwidth
	* Already have a cursor-increment hack.
	* Also it doesn't display punctuation correctly?
* Look at .CGX
* Any way to change the text speed?
	* Battles display text instantly. Might be nice to get instant text everywhere else
	* Nametags also display instantly...
	* Seems like more of a last-minute thing, but the sooner I do this the more time I'll save!
